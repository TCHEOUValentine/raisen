# RAISEN

## What is this ?

A simple colorscheme I made :3

I hope you will like it

## Inspirations

It is inspired by the color palette of my genshin main uwu

## Making of the RAISEN theme
The colorscheme base is the amazing [iceberg theme](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) of [cocopon](https://github.com/cocopon) but I made a lot of changes and additions to it thanks to the [documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html).

The airline theme base is the awesome [minimalist theme](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/minimalist.vim). I changed some colors but almost all of the code is from this file.

### If you use Plug to manage your vim plugin 

Just add this line to your `.vimrc` file

Clone the repository

In the `.vim/` directory

- Go in that directory

- Copy and paste the `raisen.vim` file there
